perseus-eng2	 The thought once occurred to us how many republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican, and again, how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people. We reflected, moreover, how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly; or if they have continued in power, no matter for how short a time, they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men.

perseus-eng2	 Those in Europe, at any rate, are said to be free and independent of one another even to this day. But Cyrus, finding the nations in Asia also independent in exactly the same way, started out with a little band of Persians and became the leader of the Medes by their full consent and of the Hyrcanians by theirs; he then conquered Syria, Assyria, Arabia, Cappadocia, both Phrygias, Lydia, Caria, Phoenicia, and Babylonia; he ruled also over Bactria, India, and Cilicia; and he was likewise king of the Sacians, Paphlagonians, Magadidae, and very many other nations, of which one could not even tell the names; he brought under his sway the Asiatic Greeks also; and, descending to the sea, he added both Cyprus and Egypt to his empire.

Moreover, the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all, in whatever direction one begin one’s journey from the palace, whether toward the east or the west, toward the north or the south.

perseus-eng2	 Soon he had become so intimately associated with other boys of his own years that he was on easy terms with them. And soon he had won their father’s hearts by visiting them and showing that he loved their sons, so that, if they desired any favour of the king, they bade their sons ask Cyrus to secure it for them. And Cyrus, because of his kindness of heart and his desire for popularity, made every effort to secure for the boys whatever they asked.

perseus-eng2	 And this was natural; for, when his grandfather fell sick, Cyrus never left him nor ceased to weep but plainly showed to all that he greatly feared that his grandfather might die. For even at night, if Astyages wanted anything, Cyrus was the first to discover it and with greater alacrity than anyone else he would jump up to perform whatever service he thought would give him pleasure, so that he won Astyages’s heart completely.

perseus-eng2	 He was, perhaps, too talkative, partly on account of his education, because he had always been required by his teacher to render an account of what he was doing and to obtain an account from others whenever he was judge; and partly also because of his natural curiosity, he was habitually putting many questions to those about him why things were thus and so; and because of his alertness of mind he readily answered questions that others put to him; so that from all these causes his talkativeness grew upon him.

perseus-eng2	 But it was not unpleasant; for just as in the body, in the case of those who have attained their growth although they are still young, there yet appears that freshness which betrays their lack of years, so also in Cyrus’s case his talkativeness disclosed not impertinence but naïveté and an affectionate disposition, so that one would be better pleased to hear still more from his lips than to sit by and have him keep silent.

perseus-eng2	 But as he advanced in stature and in years to the time of attaining youth’s estate, he then came to use fewer words, his voice was more subdued, and he became so bashful that he actually blushed whenever he met his elders; and that puppy-like manner of breaking in upon anybody and everybody alike he no longer exhibited with so much forwardness.

perseus-eng2	 The boys liked him, too; for in all the contests in which those of the same age are wont often to engage with one another he did not challenge his mates to those in which he knew he was superior, but he proposed precisely those exercises in which he knew he was not their equal, saying that he would do better than they; and he would at once take the lead, jumping up upon the horses to contend on horseback either in archery or in throwing the spear, although he was not yet a good rider, and when he was beaten he laughed at himself most heartily.

perseus-eng2	 And as he did not shirk being beaten and take refuge in refusing to do that in which he was beaten, but persevered in attempting to do better next time, he speedily became the equal of his fellows in horsemanship and soon on account of his love for the sport he surpassed them; and before long he had exhausted the supply of animals in the park by hunting and shooting and killing them, so that Astyages was no longer able to collect animals for him.

perseus-eng2	 of such as have come to you before as mercenaries;

perseus-eng2	 Listen then, said Cyaxares.
perseus-eng2	 Croesus, the king of Lydia, is said to be coming at the head of 10,000 horsemen and more than 40,000 peltasts and bowmen.
perseus-eng2	 And they say that Artacamas, the king of Greater Phrygia, is coming at the head of 8000 horse and not fewer than 40,000 lancers and peltasts; and Aribaeus, the king of Cappadocia, has 6000 horse and not fewer than 30,000 bowmen and peltasts; while the Arabian, Aragdus, has about 10,000 horsemen, about 100 chariots of war, and a great host of slingers.

perseus-eng2	 The Carians, however, and Cilicians and Paphlagonians, they say, have not joined the expedition, although they have been invited to do so.
perseus-eng2	 But the Assyrians, both those from Babylon and those from the rest of Assyria, will bring, I think, not fewer than 20,000 horse and not fewer, I am sure, than 200 war-chariots, and a vast number of infantry, I suppose;
perseus-eng2	 at any rate, they used to have as many as that whenever they invaded our country.
perseus-eng2	 You mean to say, said Cyrus, that the enemy have 60,000 horse and more than 200,000 peltasts and bowmen.
perseus-eng2	 And at how many, pray, do you estimate the number of your own forces?
perseus-eng2	 There are, said he, of the Medes more than 10,000 horse;
perseus-eng2	 and the peltasts and bowmen might be, from a country like ours, some 60,000;
perseus-eng2	 while from our neighbours, the Armenians, we shall get 4000 horse and 20,000 foot.
perseus-eng2	 That is to say, said Cyrus, we have less than one-fourth as many horsemen as the enemy and about half as many foot-soldiers.
perseus-eng2	 Tell me, then, said Cyaxares, do you not consider the Persian force small which you say you are bringing?
perseus-eng2	 Yes, said Cyrus; but we will consider later whether we need more men or not.
perseus-eng2	 Now tell me, he went on, what each party’s method of fighting is.
perseus-eng2	 About the same with all, said Cyaxares;
perseus-eng2	 for there are bowmen and spearmen both on their side and on ours.
perseus-eng2	 Well then, said Cyrus, as their arms are of that sort, we must fight at long range.
perseus-eng2	 Yes, said Cyaxares, that will be necessary.
perseus-eng2	 In that case, then, the victory will be with the side that has the greater numbers;
perseus-eng2	 for the few would be wounded and killed off by the many sooner than the many by the few.
perseus-eng2	 If that is so, Cyrus, then what better plan could any one think of than to send to Persia to inform them that if anything happens to the Medes, the danger will extend to the Persians, and at the same time to ask for a larger army?
perseus-eng2	 Why, said Cyrus, let me assure you that even though all the Persians were to come, we should not surpass the enemy in point of numbers.
perseus-eng2	 What better plan do you see than this?
perseus-eng2	 If I were you, said Cyrus, I should as quickly as possible have armour made for all the Persians who are coming here just like that of the so-called peers who are coming from our country —
perseus-eng2	 that is, a corselet to wear about the breast, a small shield upon the left arm, and a scimitar or sabre in the right hand.
perseus-eng2	 And if you provide these weapons, you will make it the safest procedure for us to fight at close quarters with the enemy, while for the enemy flight will prove preferable to standing their ground.
perseus-eng2	 And it is for us, he continued, to range ourselves against those who hold their ground,
perseus-eng2	 while those of them who run away we propose to leave to you and the cavalry, that they may have no chance to stand their ground or to turn back.
perseus-eng2	 Thus Cyrus spoke.
perseus-eng2	 And to Cyaxares it seemed that he spoke to the point; and he no longer talked of sending for reinforcements, but he set about procuring the arms as suggested.
perseus-eng2	 And they were almost ready when the Persian peers came with the army from Persia.
perseus-eng2	 Thereupon Cyrus is said to have called the peers together and said:
perseus-eng2	 My friends: When I saw you thus equipped and ready in heart to grapple with the enemy in a hand-to-hand encounter, and when I observed that those Persians who follow you are so armed as to do their fighting standing as far off as possible, I was afraid lest, few in number and unaccompanied by others to support you, you might fall in with a large division of the enemy and come to some harm.
perseus-eng2	 Now then, said he, you have brought with you men blameless in bodily strength;
perseus-eng2	 and they are to have arms like ours;
perseus-eng2	 but to steel their hearts is our task;
perseus-eng2	 for it is not the whole duty of an officer to show himself valiant, but he must also take care that his men be as valiant as possible.
perseus-eng2	 Thus he spoke.
perseus-eng2	 And they were all delighted, for they thought they were going into battle with more to support them.
perseus-eng2	 And one of them also spoke as follows:
perseus-eng2	 Now, he began, it will perhaps sound strange if I advise Cyrus to say something on our behalf, when those who are to fight along with us receive their arms.
perseus-eng2	 But I venture the suggestion, for I know that when men have most power to do both good and ill, then their words also are the most likely to sink deep into the hearts of the hearers.
perseus-eng2	 And if such persons give presents, even though the gifts be of less worth than those given by equals, still the recipients value them more highly.
perseus-eng2	 And now, said he, our Persian comrades will be more highly pleased to be exhorted by Cyrus than by us; and when they have taken their place among the peers they will feel that they hold this honour with more security because conferred by their prince and their general than if the same honour were bestowed by us.
perseus-eng2	 However, our co-operation must not be wanting, but in every way and by all means we must steel the hearts of our men.
perseus-eng2	 For the braver these men are, the more to our advantage it will be.
perseus-eng2	 Fellow-citizens of Persia, you were born and bred upon the same soil as we; the bodies you have are no whit inferior to ours, and it is not likely that you have hearts in the least less brave than our own.
perseus-eng2	 In spite of this, in our own country you did not enjoy equal privileges with us, but because you were obliged to earn your own livelihood.
perseus-eng2	 Now, however, with the help of the gods, I shall see to it that you are provided with the necessaries of life;
perseus-eng2	 and you are permitted, if you wish, to receive arms like ours, to face the same danger as we, and, if any fair success crowns our enterprise, to be counted worthy of an equal share with us.
perseus-eng2	 Now, up to this time you have been bowmen and lancers, and so have we; and if you were not quite our equals in the use of these arms, there is nothing surprising about that;
perseus-eng2	 for you had not the leisure to practise with them that we had.
perseus-eng2	 But with this equipment we shall have no advantage over you.
perseus-eng2	 In any case, every man will have a corselet fitted to his breast, upon his left arm a shield, such as we have all been accustomed to carry, and in his right hand a sabre or scimitar with which, you see, we must strike those opposed to us at such close range that we need not fear to miss our aim when we strike.
perseus-eng2	 In this armour, then, how could any one of us have the advantage over another except in courage?
perseus-eng2	 And this it is proper for you to cherish in your hearts no less than we.
perseus-eng2	 For why is it more proper for us than for you to desire victory, which gains and keeps safe all things beautiful and all things good?
perseus-eng2	 And what reason is there that we, any more than you, should desire that superiority in arms which gives to the victors all the belongings of the vanquished?
perseus-eng2	 He said in conclusion:
perseus-eng2	 You have heard all.
perseus-eng2	 You see your arms;
perseus-eng2	 whosoever will, let him take them and have his name enrolled with the captain in the same companies with us.
perseus-eng2	 But whosoever is satisfied to be in the position of a mercenary, let him remain in the armour of the hired soldiery.
perseus-eng2	 Thus he spoke.
perseus-eng2	 And when the Persians heard it, they thought that if they were unwilling to accept, when invited to share the same toils and enjoy the same rewards, they should deserve to live in want through all time.
perseus-eng2	 And so they were all enrolled and all took up the arms.
perseus-eng2	 And first of all he received quartermasters from Cyaxares and commanded them to furnish ready made for each of the soldiers a liberal supply of everything that he needed.
perseus-eng2	 And when he had provided for this, he had left them nothing to do but to practise the arts of war, for he thought he had observed that those became best in any given thing who gave up paying attention to many things and devoted themselves to that alone.
perseus-eng2	 So, in the drill itself he relieved them of even the practice with bow and spear and left them only the drill with sword and shield and breastplate.
perseus-eng2	 And so he at once brought home to them the conviction that they must go into a hand-to-hand encounter with the enemy or else admit that as allies they were good for nothing.
perseus-eng2	 But such an admission is hard for those who know that they are being maintained for no other purpose than to fight for those who maintain them.
perseus-eng2	 As rewards, moreover, he offered the following: in the case of captains, those who were thought to have got their companies into the best condition should be made colonels;
perseus-eng2	 Moreover, all these officers not only had a right to claim the respect of their subordinates, but other distinctions also appropriate to each office followed in course.
perseus-eng2	 And to those who should deserve praise still greater hopes were held out, in case in time to come any greater good fortune should befall.
perseus-eng2	 Besides, he offered prizes of victory to whole companies and to whole platoons and to squads of ten and of five likewise, if they showed themselves implicitly obedient to the officers and very ready in performing the aforementioned duties.
perseus-eng2	 And the prizes of victory for these divisions were just such as were appropriate to groups of men.
perseus-eng2	 Such, then, were the competitions appointed, and the army began to train for them.
perseus-eng2	 Then, he had tents made for them — in number, as many as there were captains; in size, large enough to accommodate each a company.
perseus-eng2	 A company, moreover, was composed of a hundred men.
perseus-eng2	 Accordingly, they lived in tents each company by itself;
perseus-eng2	 for Cyrus thought that in occupying tents together they had the following advantages for the coming conflict: They saw one another provided for in the same way, and there could be no possible pretext of unjust discrimination that could lead any one to allow himself to prove less brave than another in the face of the enemy.
perseus-eng2	 And he thought that if they tented together it would help them to get acquainted with one another.
perseus-eng2	 And in getting acquainted with one another, he thought, a feeling of considerateness was more likely to be engendered in them all, while those who are unacquainted seem somehow more indifferent — like people when they are in the dark.
perseus-eng2	 He thought also that their tenting together helped them not a little to gain a perfect acquaintance with their positions.
perseus-eng2	 For the captains had the companies under them in as perfect order as when a company was marching single file, and the lieutenants their platoons, and the sergeants and corporals their squads in the same way.
perseus-eng2	 Cyrus also took care that they should never come to luncheon or to dinner unless they had had a sweat.
perseus-eng2	 For he would get them into a sweat by taking them out hunting; or he would contrive such sports as would make them sweat; or again, if he happened to have some business or other to attend to, he so conducted it that they should not come back without having had a sweat.
perseus-eng2	 For this he considered conducive to their enjoying their meals, to their health, and to their being able to endure hardships, and he thought that hardships conduced to their being more reasonable toward one another, for even horses that work together stand more quietly together.
perseus-eng2	 At any rate, those who are conscious that they have been well drilled are certainly more courageous in the face of the enemy.
perseus-eng2	 And for himself Cyrus had a tent made big enough to accommodate all whom he might invite to dinner.
perseus-eng2	 Now he usually invited as many of the captains as he thought proper, and sometimes also some of the lieutenants and sergeants and corporals; and occasionally he invited some of the privates, sometimes a squad of five together, or a squad of ten, or a platoon, or a whole company in a body.
perseus-eng2	 And he also used to invite individuals as a mark of honour, whenever he saw that they had done what he himself wished everybody to do.
perseus-eng2	 And the same dishes were always placed before those whom he invited to dinner as before himself.
perseus-eng2	 The quartermasters in the army he always allowed an equal share of everything;
perseus-eng2	 for he thought that it was fair to show no less regard for the purveyors of the army stores than for heralds or ambassadors.
perseus-eng2	 And that was reasonable, for he held that they must be trustworthy, familiar with military affairs, and intelligent, and, in addition to that, energetic, quick, resolute, steady.
perseus-eng2	 And still further, Cyrus knew that the quartermasters also must have the qualities which those have who are considered most efficient and that they must train themselves not to refuse any service but to consider that it is their duty to perform whatever the general might require of them.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.1.803
perseus-eng2	 Whenever Cyrus entertained company at dinner, he always took pains that the conversation introduced should be as entertaining as possible and that it should incite to good.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.1.804
perseus-eng2	 On one occasion he opened the conversation as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.1.805
perseus-eng2	 "Tell me, men," said he, "do our new comrades seem to be any worse off than we because they have not been educated in the same way as we, or pray do you think that there will be no difference between us either in social intercourse or when we shall have to contend with the enemy?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.2.806
perseus-eng2	 Well," said Hystaspas in reply,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.2.807
perseus-eng2	 "for my part, I cannot tell yet how they will appear in the face of the enemy.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.2.808
perseus-eng2	 But in social intercourse, by the gods, some of them seem ill-mannered enough.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.2.809
perseus-eng2	 The other day, at any rate," he explained, "Cyaxares had meat sent in to each company, and as it was passed around each one of us got three pieces or even more.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.2.810
perseus-eng2	 And the first time round the cook began with me as he passed it around;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.2.811
perseus-eng2	 but when he came in the second time to pass it, I bade him begin with the last and pass it around the other way.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.3.812
perseus-eng2	 Then one of the men sitting in the middle of the circle called out and said, "By Zeus, this is not fair at all — at any rate, if they are never going to begin with us here in the middle."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.3.813
perseus-eng2	 And when I heard that, I was vexed that any one should think that he had less than another and I called him to me at once.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.3.814
perseus-eng2	 He obeyed, showing good discipline in this at least.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.3.815
perseus-eng2	 But when that which was being passed came to us, only the smallest pieces were left, as one might expect, for we were the last to be served.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.3.816
perseus-eng2	 Thereupon he was greatly vexed and said to himself: "Such luck! that I should happen to have been called here just now!"
perseus-eng2	 Such luck! that I should happen to have been called here just now!
perseus-eng2	 And I said:
perseus-eng2	 Never mind;
perseus-eng2	 they will begin with us next time, and you, being first, will get the biggest piece.
perseus-eng2	 And at that moment the cook began to pass around the third time what was left of the course;
perseus-eng2	 and the man helped himself; and then he thought the piece he had taken too small;
perseus-eng2	 so he put back the piece he had, with the intention of taking another.
perseus-eng2	 And the cook, thinking that he did not want any more to eat, went on passing it before he got his other piece.
perseus-eng2	 Thereupon he took his mishap so to heart that he lost not only the meat he had taken but also what was still left of his sauce; for this last he upset somehow or other in the confusion of his vexation and anger over his hard luck.
perseus-eng2	 The lieutenant nearest us saw it and laughed and clapped his hands in amusement.
perseus-eng2	 And I,  he added,  pretended to cough;
perseus-eng2	 for even I could not keep from laughing.
perseus-eng2	 Such is one man, Cyrus, that I present to you as one of our comrades.
perseus-eng2	 At this they laughed, of course.
perseus-eng2	 But another of the captains said:
perseus-eng2	 Our friend here, it seems, Cyrus, has fallen in with a very ill-mannered fellow.
perseus-eng2	 But as for me, when you had instructed us about the arrangement of the lines and dismissed us with orders each to teach his own company what we had learned from you, why then I went and proceeded to drill one platoon, just as the others also did.
perseus-eng2	 I assigned the lieutenant his place first and arranged next after him a young recruit, and the rest, as I thought proper.
perseus-eng2	 Then I took my stand out in front of them facing the platoon, and when it seemed to me to be the proper time, I gave the command to go ahead.
perseus-eng2	 And that young recruit, mark you, stepped ahead — of the lieutenant and marched in front of him!
perseus-eng2	 And when I saw it, I said:
perseus-eng2	 Fellow, what are you doing?
perseus-eng2	 I am going ahead, as you ordered,  said he.
perseus-eng2	 Well,  said I,
perseus-eng2	 I ordered not only you, but all to go ahead.
perseus-eng2	 When he heard this, he turned about to his comrades and said:
perseus-eng2	 Don’t  you hear him scolding? He orders us all to go ahead.
perseus-eng2	 Then the men all ran past their lieutenant and came toward me.
perseus-eng2	 But when the lieutenant ordered them back to their places, they were indignant and said:
perseus-eng2	 Pray, which one are we to obey?
perseus-eng2	 For now the one orders us to go ahead, and the other will not let us.
perseus-eng2	 I took this good-naturedly, however, and when I had got them in position again, I gave instructions that no one of those behind should stir before the one in front led off, but that all should have their attention on this only — to follow the man in front.
perseus-eng2	 But when a certain man who was about to start for Persia  came up and asked me for the letter which I had written home, I bade the lieutenant run and fetch it, for he knew where it had been placed.
perseus-eng2	 So he started off on a run, and that young recruit followed, as he was, breastplate and sword; and then the whole fifty, seeing him run, ran after.
perseus-eng2	 And the men came back bringing the letter.
perseus-eng2	 So exactly, you see, does my company, at least, carry out all your orders.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.10.853
perseus-eng2	 The rest, of course, laughed over the military escort of the letter,
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.10.854
perseus-eng2	 and Cyrus said:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.10.855
perseus-eng2	 "O Zeus and all the gods! What sort of men we have then as our comrades; they are so easily won by kindness that we can make many of them our firm friends with even a little piece of meat; and they are so obedient that they obey even before the orders are given.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.10.856
perseus-eng2	 I, for my part, do not know what sort of soldiers one could ask to have in preference to these!"

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.11.857
perseus-eng2	 Thus Cyrus praised his soldiers, laughing at the same time.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.11.858
perseus-eng2	 But one of his captains, Aglaïtadas by name, one of the most austere of men, happened to be in Cyrus’s tent at the same time and he spoke somewhat as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.11.859
perseus-eng2	 "You don’t mean to say, Cyrus, that you think what these fellows have been telling is true?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.11.860
perseus-eng2	 "Well," said Cyrus, "what object could they have, pray, in telling a lie?"

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.11.861
perseus-eng2	 "What object, indeed," said the other, "except that they wanted to raise a laugh; and so they tell these stories and try to humbug us."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.12.862
perseus-eng2	 "Hush," said Cyrus, "don’t call these men humbugs.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.12.863
perseus-eng2	 For to me, the name humbug seems to apply to those who pretend that they are richer than they are or braver than they are, and to those who promise to do what they cannot do, and that, too, when it is evident that they do this only for the sake of getting something or making some gain.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.12.864
perseus-eng2	 But those who invent stories to amuse their companions and not for their own gain nor at the expense of their hearers nor to the injury of any one, why should these men not be called witty and entertaining rather than humbugs?"

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.13.865
perseus-eng2	 Thus Cyrus defended those who had furnished the fun,
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.13.866
perseus-eng2	 and the captain himself who had told the anecdote about his platoon said:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.13.867
perseus-eng2	 "Verily, Aglaïtadas, you might find serious fault with us, if we tried to make you weep, like some authors who invent touching incidents in their poems and stories and try to move us to tears; but now, although you yourself know that we wish to entertain you and not to do you any harm at all, still you heap such reproaches upon us."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.14.868
perseus-eng2	 "Aye, by Zeus," said Aglaïtadas, "and justly, too, since he that makes his friends laugh seems to me to do them much less service than he who makes them weep;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.14.869
perseus-eng2	 and if you will look at it rightly, you, too, will find that I speak the truth.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.14.870
perseus-eng2	 At any rate, fathers develop self-control in their sons by making them weep, and teachers impress good lessons upon their pupils in the same way, and the laws, too, turn the citizens to justice by making them weep.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.14.871
perseus-eng2	 But could you say that those who make us laugh either do good to our bodies or make our minds any more fitted for the management of our private business or of the affairs of state?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.872
perseus-eng2	 Hereupon Hystaspas answered somewhat as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.15.873
perseus-eng2	 "If you will heed me, Aglaïtadas, you will freely expend this very valuable commodity upon your enemies and will try to set them to weeping;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.874
perseus-eng2	 but upon us and your friends here you will please to lavish this cheap article, laughter.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.15.875
perseus-eng2	 And you can, for I know you must have a great quantity of it stored up;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.876
perseus-eng2	 for you have never spent it upon yourself nor do you ever afford any laughter for your friends or for your enemies if you can help it.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.15.877
perseus-eng2	 So you have no excuse for begrudging us a laugh."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.878
perseus-eng2	 Aglaïtadas said:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.15.879
perseus-eng2	 "What, do you really think, Hystaspas, to get a laugh out of me?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.880
perseus-eng2	 The other captain said:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.15.881
perseus-eng2	 "Well, by Zeus,he is a very foolish fellow, let me tell you, if he does;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.15.882
perseus-eng2	 for I believe one might rub fire out of you more easily than provoke a laugh from you."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.16.883
perseus-eng2	 At this, of course, the rest laughed; for they knew his character, and Aglaïtadas himself smiled at the sally.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.16.884
perseus-eng2	 And Cyrus, seeing him brighten up, said: "It is not right, captain, for you to corrupt our most serious man by persuading him to laugh, and that, too," said he, "when he is such a foe to laughter."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.17.885
perseus-eng2	 With that, the subject was dropt.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.17.886
perseus-eng2	 But at this point Chrysantas spoke as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.18.887
perseus-eng2	 "Cyrus, and all you here present, I observe, for my part, that some have come out with us who are of superior merit, others who are less deserving than we.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.18.888
perseus-eng2	 Now, if we meet with success, these will all expect to have share and share alike.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.18.889
perseus-eng2	 And yet I do not believe that anything in the world is more unfair than for the bad and good to be awarded equal shares."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.18.890
perseus-eng2	 "Well, then, in the name of the gods, my men," Cyrus replied to this,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.18.891
perseus-eng2	 "will it not be a very good thing for us to suggest to the army a debate on this question: shall we, in case God gives us any success to reward our toils, give to all an equal share or shall we take into consideration each man’s services and bestow increased rewards upon him commensurate with them?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.19.892
perseus-eng2	 "And what is the use," said Chrysantas, "of starting a discussion concerning this matter?

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.19.893
perseus-eng2	 Why not rather announce that you propose to do thus and so? Pray, did you not announce the games and offer the prizes that way?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.19.894
perseus-eng2	 "Yes, by Zeus," said Cyrus; "but this is not a parallel case.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.19.895
perseus-eng2	 For what the men obtain by fighting, that, I suppose, they will consider their own common property;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.19.896
perseus-eng2	 but the command of the army they still consider fairly to be mine, so that when I appoint the judges, I am sure they think I am within my rights."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.20.897
perseus-eng2	 "And do you really believe," said Chrysantas, "that the mass meeting would adopt a resolution that each one should not have an equal share, but that the best should have the preference both in honours and gifts?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.20.898
perseus-eng2	 "Yes," said Cyrus, "I do, partly because we recommend it, and partly because it is mean to oppose a proposition that the one who suffers the most and does the most for the state should also receive the highest rewards.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.20.899
perseus-eng2	 "And I think," said he, "that even to the worst it will seem proper that the good should have the larger share."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.21.900
perseus-eng2	 Now Cyrus wished for the sake of the peers themselves that this measure should pass;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.21.901
perseus-eng2	 for he thought that even they themselves would be better, if they knew that they also should be judged by their works and should receive according to their deserts.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.21.902
perseus-eng2	 And so it seemed to him to be the proper time to bring this matter to a vote now, while the peers also were questioning the commoners’ claims to equality.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.21.903
perseus-eng2	 Accordingly, those in the tenth agreed to submit the question to a discussion and they said that whoever thought himself to be a man ought to advocate it.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.22.904
perseus-eng2	 But one of the captains said with a laugh:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.22.905
perseus-eng2	 "Well, I know a man of the commoners, too, who will support the proposition not to have share and share alike in that indiscriminate fashion."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.22.906
perseus-eng2	 Another asked him whom he meant;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.22.907
perseus-eng2	 and he answered:

perseus-eng2	 "Well, men," said Cyrus, "I am convinced that such fellows as this one of whom our friend has just been telling us must be weeded out of the ranks, if we are to keep our army industrious and obedient.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.24.919
perseus-eng2	 but virtue, leading up hill, is not at all clever at attracting men at first sight and without reflection; and especially is this true, when there are others who call in the opposite direction, to what is downhill and easy."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.25.920

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.28.930
perseus-eng2	 After that Cyrus began again to jest with them;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.2.28.931
perseus-eng2	 for he had observed that one of the lieutenants had brought along as a guest and companion at table an exceedingly hairy and exceedingly ill-favoured man; and addressing the lieutenant by name he spoke as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.28.932
perseus-eng2	 'Well, Sambaulas,' said he, 'so you also have adopted the Greek fashion, have you, and take about with you everywhere this youngster who is now beside you, because he is so handsome?'

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.2.30.938
perseus-eng2	 "By Zeus, fellows," he answered,

perseus-eng2	 "I will tell you.

perseus-eng2	 Things of this sort, both grave and gay, were said and done at the dinner party.

glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.1.951
perseus-eng2	 Then on the morrow, Cyrus called all his soldiers together and spoke as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.2.952
perseus-eng2	 "Friends, the conflict is at hand;

perseus-eng2	 As for the prizes of victory, if we are victorious — and we must assume that we shall be and work to that end — it is evident that the enemy and all that is theirs will belong to us.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.2.955
perseus-eng2	 But, on the other hand, if we are defeated — in this case, too, all the possessions of the vanquished are invariably the prizes set for the victors."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.3.956
perseus-eng2	 "Accordingly," said he, "you must realize that when men who are united as comrades in war are fully persuaded that nothing will come out as it should unless each individual man exerts himself, then many splendid achievements are speedily accomplished;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.3.957
perseus-eng2	 for nothing that needs to be done is neglected.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.3.958

glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.4.959
perseus-eng2	 "And God has ordained it in some such way as this:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.4.960
perseus-eng2	 in the case of those who will not compel themselves to work out their own good, he assigns others to be their commanders.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.4.961
perseus-eng2	 Now, therefore, let any one stand up and speak to this question before us, whether he thinks that valour would be more cultivated among us, if the one who will do and dare most is also to receive the greatest rewards, or if we know that it makes no difference whether a man be a coward or not,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.4.962

glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.5.963
perseus-eng2	 Hereupon Chrysantas, one of the peers, a man neither large nor powerful to look upon, but preeminent in understanding, stood up and spoke:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.5.964
perseus-eng2	 "Well, Cyrus," said he, "I think that you are introducing this discussion not because you think that the bad ought to have an equal share with the good, but because you wish to prove whether a single man will really be found who will care to let it be known that he thinks that, even if he himself does nothing good and noble, he should have an equal share of that which others win by their valour.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.6.965
perseus-eng2	 Now I," he went on, "am neither fleet of foot nor strong of arm, and I know that in view of what I shall accomplish by my bodily strength I should not be judged either the first or the second, or even, I suppose, the thousandth, and perhaps not even the ten thousandth.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.6.966
perseus-eng2	 But on this point I am perfectly clear, that if those who are powerful men take matters vigorously in hand, I shall have as large a share of any good fortune that may come as I deserve.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.6.967
perseus-eng2	 But if the bad do nothing and the good and strong lose heart, I am afraid," said he, "that I shall have a larger share than I wish of something other than good."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.7.968
perseus-eng2	 Thus spoke Chrysantas.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.7.969
perseus-eng2	 And after him Pheraulas stood up, one of the Persian commoners, but a man who for some reason or other had from the beginning won Cyrus’s confidence and affection; besides he was well-favoured in body and a gentleman at heart. His speech was as follows:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.8.970
perseus-eng2	 "I think, Cyrus," said he, "and all you Persians here assembled, that we are all now starting on an equal footing in a contest of merit;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.8.971
perseus-eng2	 for I observe that we are all taking the same bodily exercise, that we all have the same rations, that we are all considered worthy to move in the same society, and that the prizes are offered alike to all.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.8.972
perseus-eng2	 For obedience to the officers has been enjoined equally upon us all, and whoever shows himself prompt to comply, I observe that he receives honour from Cyrus.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.8.973
perseus-eng2	 Again, to be brave in the face of the enemy is not a thing to be expected of one and not of another, but it is considered far the noblest thing for all alike.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.9.974
perseus-eng2	 And now," he continued, "we have been initiated into a method of fighting, which, I observe, all men naturally understand, just as in the case of other creatures each understands some method of fighting which it has not learned from any other source than from instinct: for instance, the bull knows how to fight with his horns, the horse with his hoofs, the dog with his teeth, the boar with his tusks.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.9.975
perseus-eng2	 And all know how to protect themselves, too, against that from which they most need protection, and that, too, though they have never gone to school to any teacher.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.10.976
perseus-eng2	 As for myself, I have understood from my very childhood how to protect the spot where I thought I was likely to receive a blow;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.10.977
perseus-eng2	 and if I had nothing else I put out my hands to hinder as well as I could the one who was trying to hit me.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.10.978
perseus-eng2	 And this I did not from having been taught to do so, but even though I was beaten for that very act of putting out my hands.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.10.979
perseus-eng2	 Furthermore, even when I was a little fellow I used to seize a sword wherever I saw one, although, I declare, I had never learned, except from instinct, even how to take hold of a sword.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.10.980
perseus-eng2	 At any rate, I used to do this, even though they tried to keep me from it — and certainly they did not teach me so to do —
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.10.981
perseus-eng2	 just as I was impelled by nature to do certain other things which my father and mother tried to keep me away from.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.10.982
perseus-eng2	 And, by Zeus, I used to hack with a sword everything that I could without being caught at it.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.10.983
perseus-eng2	 For this was not only instinctive, like walking and running, but I thought it was fun in addition to its being natural.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.11.984
perseus-eng2	 Be that as it may," he went on, "since this method of fighting awaits us, which demands courage more than skill, why should we not gladly compete with the peers here?
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.11.985
perseus-eng2	 For the prizes proposed for excellence are equal, but we shall go into the trial not having at stake interests equal with theirs; for they have at stake a life of honour, which is the most happy of all, while we risk only a life of toil unhonoured, which I think is most burdensome.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.12.986
perseus-eng2	 And this, comrades, gives me the most courage for the competition with these gentlemen, that Cyrus is to be the judge;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.12.987
perseus-eng2	 for he decides not with partiality, but (I swear it by the gods) I verily think that Cyrus loves no less than himself those whom he recognizes as valiant. At any rate, I observe that, whatever he has, he is much more pleased to give it to them than to keep it for himself.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.13.988
perseus-eng2	 And yet I know that these men pride themselves upon having been trained, as they say, to endure hunger and thirst and cold, but they do not know that in this we also have been trained by a better teacher than they have had;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.13.989
perseus-eng2	 for in these branches there is no better teacher than necessity, which has given us exceedingly thorough instruction in them."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.15.991
perseus-eng2	 "Let me inform you, therefore, Cyrus," said he, "that I, for one, shall not only enter this contest, but I shall also expect you to reward me according to my deserts, whatever I am, for better or worse.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.15.992
perseus-eng2	 And you, my fellow-commoners," he concluded, "I recommend you to enter with alacrity into the competition with these gentlemen in this sort of warfare;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.15.993
perseus-eng2	 for now they have been trapped in a contest with commoners."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.16.994
perseus-eng2	 Thus Pheraulas spoke.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.16.995
perseus-eng2	 And many others from both orders rose to speak in favour of the measure.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.16.996
perseus-eng2	 They decided that each one should receive rewards according to his deserts, and that Cyrus should be the judge.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.16.997
perseus-eng2	 Thus, then, the matter was satisfactorily settled.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.18.999
perseus-eng2	 Now when they had taken their stand thus equipped, he gave the order to begin battle.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.18.1000
perseus-eng2	 Then those on the one side threw their clods, and some struck the breastplates and shields, others also struck the thighs and greaves of their opponents.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.18.1001
perseus-eng2	 But when they came into close quarters, those who had the cudgels struck the others — some upon the thighs, others upon the arms, others upon the shins; and as still others stooped to pick up clods, the cudgels came down upon their necks and backs.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.18.1002
perseus-eng2	 And finally, when the cudgel-bearers had put their opponents to flight, they pursued them laying on the blows amid shouts of laughter and merriment.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.18.1003
perseus-eng2	 And then again, changing about, the other side took the cudgels with the same result to their opponents, who in turn threw clods.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.18.1004
perseus-eng2	 And they answered that they had been hit with the clods.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.20.1006
perseus-eng2	 And he inquired further, whether it had happened when they were close together or far apart.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.20.1007
perseus-eng2	 And they said it was when they were far apart.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.20.1008
perseus-eng2	 But when they came to close quarters, it was capital fun — so the cudgel-bearers said;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.20.1009
perseus-eng2	 but those who had been thoroughly drubbed with the cudgels cried out that it did not seem any fun to them to be beaten at close quarters,
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.20.1010
perseus-eng2	 and at the same time they showed the marks of the cudgels on their arms and their necks and some also on their faces.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.20.1011
perseus-eng2	 And then, as was natural, they laughed at one another.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.20.1012
perseus-eng2	 On the following day the whole plain was full of men following their example;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.20.1013
perseus-eng2	 and if they had nothing more important to do, they indulged in this sport.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.21.1014
perseus-eng2	 And once he saw another captain leading his company up from the river left about in single file and ordering when he thought it was proper, the second division and then the third and the fourth to advance to the front;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.21.1015
perseus-eng2	 and when the lieutenants were in a row in front, he ordered each division to march up in double file.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.21.1016
perseus-eng2	 Thus the sergeants came to stand on the front line.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.21.1017
perseus-eng2	 Again, when he thought proper, he ordered the divisions to line up four abreast; in this formation, then, the corporals in their turn came to stand four abreast in each division;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.21.1018
perseus-eng2	 and when they arrived at the doors of the tent, he commanded them to fall into single file again, and in this order he led the first division into the tent;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.21.1019
perseus-eng2	 the second he ordered to fall in line behind the first and follow, and, giving orders in like manner to the third and fourth, he led them inside.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.21.1020
perseus-eng2	 And when he had thus led them all in, he gave them their places at dinner in the order in which they came in. Pleased with him for his gentleness of discipline and for his painstaking, Cyrus invited this company also with its captain to dinner. With another doubling up of ranks, they assume a front of sixteen men and a depth of six: Finally in these groups of six each, they are led, single file, in to dinner.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.22.1021
perseus-eng2	 Now there was present another captain who had been invited to the dinner and he said: "Cyrus, will you not invite my company to your tent?
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.22.1022
perseus-eng2	 My company, too, does all this when we go to mess,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.22.1023
perseus-eng2	 and when the meal is finished the rear-guard leader of the last division leads that division out, keeping in the rear those whose place in the battle line is in front;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.22.1024
perseus-eng2	 then, next after them, the second rear-guard leader brings out the men of the second division, and the third and the fourth in like manner, in order that," he explained, "they may also know how to withdraw, if ever it is necessary to retreat before the enemy.

perseus-eng2	 And when we take our places on the parade-ground, I take the lead, when we march toward the east, and the first division of the company goes first, the second in its proper order, and then the third and the fourth and the squads of ten and five in each division, until I give the order for some change of formation;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.22.1026

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.22.1027
perseus-eng2	 Still, even so, they have to look to me for the commands, though I march last, so that they may get into the habit of obeying just the same whether they follow or whether they lead."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.23.1028
perseus-eng2	 asked Cyrus.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.23.1029
perseus-eng2	 "Do you always do that way?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.23.1030
perseus-eng2	 "Yes, by Zeus," said he, "as often as we go to dinner.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.23.1031
perseus-eng2	 "Well then," said Cyrus, "I will invite you, because you give your lines practice both in coming and in going, by night and by day, and also because you give your bodies exercise by marching about, and improve your minds by instruction.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.23.1032
perseus-eng2	 Since, therefore, you do all this doubly, it is only fair that I should furnish you a double feast also."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.24.1033
perseus-eng2	 "No, by Zeus," said the captain, "at any rate not on the same day, unless you will furnish us with double stomachs as well."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.24.1034
perseus-eng2	 Thus they brought that dinner to a close.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.3.24.1035
perseus-eng2	 And on the following day Cyrus invited that company, as he had promised, and again the next day.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.3.24.1036
perseus-eng2	 And when the others heard about it, they all followed, in the future, the example of that company.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.1.1037
perseus-eng2	 Once when Cyrus was holding a general review and parade of all his men under arms, a messenger came from Cyaxares saying that an embassy had arrived from India.

perseus-eng2	 "He therefore bids you come as soon as possible.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.1.1039

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.2.1041
perseus-eng2	 And when Cyrus heard this, he gave orders to the captain who was stationed first to take his stand at the head of the line, bringing up his company in single file and keeping himself to the right; he told him to transmit the same order to the second captain and to pass it on through all the lines.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.2.1042
perseus-eng2	 And they obeyed at once and passed the order on, and they all executed it promptly, and in a little while they were three hundred abreast on the front line, for that was the number of the captains, and a hundred men deep.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.3.1043
perseus-eng2	 And when they had got into their places, he ordered them to follow as he himself should lead.

perseus-eng2	 while he presented himself before Cyaxares in his Persian dress, which was not at all showy.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.5.1050
perseus-eng2	 When Cyaxares saw him, he was pleased at his promptness but displeased with the plainness of his dress and said:

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.5.1051
perseus-eng2	 "How is this, Cyrus?
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.5.1052
perseus-eng2	 What do you mean by appearing thus before the Indians?

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.5.1053
perseus-eng2	 Now I wished you to appear with as much magnificence as possible,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.6.1055
perseus-eng2	 "Should I be showing you more respect, Cyaxares," Cyrus made reply to this,
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.6.1056
perseus-eng2	 "if I arrayed myself in purple and adorned myself with bracelets and put on a necklace and at my leisure obeyed your orders, than I have in obeying you with such dispatch and accompanied by so large and so efficient an army? And I have come myself adorned with sweat and marks of haste to honour you and I present the others likewise obedient to you."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.6.1057
perseus-eng2	 Thus Cyrus spoke,

perseus-eng2	 and Cyaxares recognizing that he was right summoned the Indians.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.7.1059
perseus-eng2	 And when the Indians came in they said that the king of India had sent them with orders to ask on what ground the Medes and the Assyrians had declared war.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.7.1060
perseus-eng2	 "And he has ordered us," they said, "when we have heard your statement, to go also to the Assyrian and ask him the same question;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.7.1061
perseus-eng2	 and finally, he bade us say to both of you that the king of India declared that when he was weighed the merits of the case, he will side with the party wronged."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.8.1062
perseus-eng2	 Well, then, Cyaxares made reply to this,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.8.1063
perseus-eng2	 "let me tell you that we are not guilty of doing any wrong to the Assyrian; but go now, if you wish, and ask him what he has to say."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.8.1064
perseus-eng2	 And Cyrus, who was present, asked Cyaxares,

perseus-eng2	 "May I also tell them what I think?"
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.8.1066

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.8.1067
perseus-eng2	 "Well then," said he, "if Cyaxares has no objection, tell the king of India that we propose, in case the Assyrian says he has been wronged by us, to choose the king of India himself to be our arbitrator."
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.8.1068
perseus-eng2	 Upon hearing this, they went away.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.9.1069
perseus-eng2	 And when they had gone out, Cyrus addressed Cyaxares as follows:
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.9.1070
perseus-eng2	 "Cyaxares, I came from home without very much money of my own,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.9.1071

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.9.1073
perseus-eng2	 Now you wonder, perhaps, how I have spent it upon them, when you are maintaining them; but I want you to know that it has gone for nothing else than rewards and entertainments, whenever I am pleased with any of my soldiers.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.9.1074
perseus-eng2	 And I want you to know," he said, "that I have done nothing else but honour and show my appreciation whenever I admired any of my soldiers."

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.10.1075
perseus-eng2	 For, said he, in the case of all those whom one wishes to make efficient coadjutors in any enterprise of any sort whatsoever, it seems to me pleasanter to draw them on by kind words and kind services rather than by compulsion and force;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.10.1076
perseus-eng2	 but in the case of those whom one wishes to make enthusiastic followers in his plans of war, one must by all means try to capture them with kind words and kind offices.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.10.1077
perseus-eng2	 For those men who are to be trusty comrades, who will not envy their commander in his successes nor betray him in his adversity, must be his friends and not his enemies.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.11.1078
perseus-eng2	 Accordingly, as I recognize this in advance, I think I need more money.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.11.1079
perseus-eng2	 However, it seems to me unreasonable for every one to be looking to you, who, I observe, are put to great expense;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.11.1080
perseus-eng2	 but I think that you and I should together lay plans that funds may never fail you.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.11.1081
perseus-eng2	 For if you have plenty, I am sure it would be possible for me to draw money whenever I needed it, especially if I should take it to spend for something that would be more to your advantage also.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.12.1082
perseus-eng2	 Now I remember hearing you say one day recently that the Armenian king despises you now, because he has heard that the enemy are coming against you, and that therefore he is neither sending troops nor paying the tribute which is due.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.12.1083
perseus-eng2	 “Yes, Cyrus,” he answered; “that is just what he is doing;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.12.1084
perseus-eng2	 and so, for my part, I am in doubt whether it is better to proceed against him and try to enforce allegiance or to let him alone for the present, for fear we bring him also upon us as an enemy, in addition to the others.”

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.13.1085
perseus-eng2	 But his residences, asked Cyrus,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.13.1087

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.13.1089
perseus-eng2	 I did not fail to attend to that.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.13.1090
perseus-eng2	 However, there are mountains where he could take refuge and for a time be safe from falling into our hands himself, and where he could insure the safety of whatever he could have carried up there secretly, unless some one should occupy the approaches and hold him in siege, as my father did.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.14.1091
perseus-eng2	 Well, Cyrus then made answer,
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.14.1092
perseus-eng2	 if you would give me as many horsemen as you think reasonable and send me there, I think that with the help of the gods I could make him send the troops and pay the tribute to you.

perseus-eng2	 And besides, I hope that he will be made a better friend to us than he now is.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.15.1094
perseus-eng2	 I also have hopes, Cyaxares replied,

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.15.1095
perseus-eng2	 that they would come to you sooner than to me;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.15.1096
perseus-eng2	 for I understand that some of his sons were among your companions in the chase;

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.15.1097
perseus-eng2	 and so, perhaps, they would join you again.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.15.1098
perseus-eng2	 And if they should fall into your hands, everything would be accomplished as we wish.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.15.1099
perseus-eng2	 Well then, said Cyrus, do you think it good policy to have this plan of ours kept a secret?
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.15.1100
perseus-eng2	 Yes, indeed, said Cyaxares; for then some of them would be more likely to fall into our hands, and besides, if one were to attack them, they would be taken unprepared.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.16.1101
perseus-eng2	 Listen then, said Cyrus, and see if you think there is anything in what I say.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.16.1102
perseus-eng2	 Now I have often hunted with all my forces near the boundary between your country and the Armenians, and have even gone there with some horsemen from among my companions here.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.16.1103
perseus-eng2	 And so, said Cyaxares, if you were to do the same again, you would excite no suspicion;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.16.1104
perseus-eng2	 but if they should notice that your force was much larger than that with which you used to hunt, this would at once look suspicious.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.17.1105
perseus-eng2	 But, said Cyrus, it is possible to devise a pretext that will be credited both here and also there, if some one bring them word that I wish to institute a great hunt;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.17.1106
perseus-eng2	 and horsemen I should ask of you openly.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.17.1107
perseus-eng2	 A very clever scheme! said Cyaxares;
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.17.1108
perseus-eng2	 and I shall refuse to give you more than a reasonable number, on the ground that I wish to visit the outposts on the Assyrian border.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.17.1109
perseus-eng2	 And that will be no lie, for in reality, said he, I do wish to go there and to make them as strong as possible.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.17.1110
perseus-eng2	 And when you have gone ahead with the forces you have and have already been hunting for two days, I will send you a sufficient number of the cavalry and infantry that are mustered with me, and you may take them and make an inroad at once.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.18.1111
perseus-eng2	 And I myself, with the rest of my forces, will try to be not far away from you, to make my appearance upon the scene, should occasion require it.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.18.1112
perseus-eng2	 Thereupon Cyaxares at once proceeded to get his cavalry and infantry together for visiting the outposts, and to send out wagon-loads of provisions on the road to the outposts.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.18.1113
perseus-eng2	 But Cyrus proceeded to offer sacrifice in behalf of his expedition, and at the same time he sent to Cyaxares and asked for some of his younger horsemen.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.18.1114
perseus-eng2	 But, although very many wished to go along, Cyaxares would not give him many.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.18.1115
perseus-eng2	 Now after Cyaxares with his forces of cavalry and infantry had already started off on the road to the outposts, Cyrus’s sacrifice turned out favourable for proceeding against the Armenian.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.19.1116
perseus-eng2	 Accordingly, he led his men out equipped as if for hunting.

cts:urn:tlg0032.tlg007:2.4.19.1117
perseus-eng2	 And as he proceeded on his way, in the very first field a hare started up.

perseus-eng2	 And an eagle flying up from the east caught sight of the hare as it ran and swooping down struck it, seized it, and carried it up, then bore it away to a hill not far off and disposed of his prey at his pleasure.

perseus-eng2	 but when he saw the army from Cyaxares approaching, he sent to them secretly and bade them take their dinner at a distance of about two parasangs, for he foresaw that this also would contribute to the secrecy of his design;

perseus-eng2	 Nevertheless, suppose you send ahead of your army some active men, in the guise of brigands both as to numbers and accoutrements; these, if they met any Armenians, would capture them and so prevent their spreading any reports; or, if they failed to capture them, they would frighten them away and so prevent their seeing the whole of your army, and would thus cause them to take precautions as against only a band of thieves.
glaux1.0-sentence	2.4.24.1140
perseus-eng2	 Do you, then, said he, do this;
